# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/plugin-react-swc) uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances.
